# Tigris

“A design system unites product teams around a common (visual) language. It reduces design debt, accelerates the product design process and builds bridges between teams working in concert to bring products to life.”

# Goals

1. Promote consistency across the brand and applications, allowing us to create a unified experience across all touch points with Appear Here.

2. Improve the efficiency of development by ensuring we’re speaking the same language. It allows our conversations to be shaped less around low-level design, and more around what really matters.
